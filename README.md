This is a bot to use in your Tinychat room,<br>
It's an aid to help moderate a room from spam and bad users,<br>
This is using the pinylib library by [nortxort](https://github.com/nortxort/),<br>
You'll need all the dependencies for this to work,<br>
You can install the modules directly in your python library or run them from the bot folder,<br>
Just make sure you have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
